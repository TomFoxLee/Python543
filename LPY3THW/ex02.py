# Exercise 02 of "Learn Python3 the Hard Way"
# Comments and Pound Characters
# "#" is called "octothorpe" or "pound character"

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.")  # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
