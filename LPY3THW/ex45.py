# Exercise 45 of "Learn Python3 the Hard Way"
# You Make a Game
#
# Function Style
#   "funtion" and "method" are the same.
#   naming function as "command".
#   keep functions small and simple.
#
# Class Style
#   use “camel case,” as in "SuperGoldFactory".
#   don't do too much in __init__ function.
#   other functions should use underscore format, so write "my_awesome_hair".
#   try not to use variables that come from the module or globals.
#   always have class Name(object) format
#
# Code Style
#   give your code vertical space so people can read it.
#   if you can’t read it out loud, it’s probably hard to read.
#
# Good Comments
#   write comments, describe WHY you are doing and WHAT you are doing.
#   comment "how to use" the function.
#   keep comments relatively short and to the point.
